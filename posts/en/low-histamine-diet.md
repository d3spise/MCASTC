Histamine is a naturally occurring chemical in the body that performs crucial functions – from regulating stomach acid to participating in immune responses. The problem arises when the body cannot keep up with breaking it down (often due to a DAO enzyme deficiency) or when its release is inadequately high, which can be a component of histamine intolerance or Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS). In such situations, a proper diet becomes the primary tool for soothing symptoms.

## Main Principles of the Diet

A low-histamine diet differs significantly from classic elimination diets. It requires not only excluding specific foods but also paying close attention to how they are stored and cooked.

- **Freshness is key:** Histamine levels in food increase the longer it is stored, due to bacterial action. Meat and fish should be frozen immediately after purchase and thawed right before preparation (preferably in cold water or a microwave, never at room temperature).
- **Avoiding leftovers:** Food cooked the previous day, even if stored in the refrigerator, gradually accumulates histamine. It is best to cook single-portion meals or freeze any excess immediately.
- **Cooking methods:** Brief boiling in water is the safest method of preparing meals. Frying, grilling, or slow cooking (e.g., in a slow cooker) can increase the histamine level in a dish.

## MCAS and Individual Triggers

In the case of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), a low-histamine diet is an absolute foundation and a necessary baseline for managing inflammation. However, it is important to remember a key nuance: hyperreactive mast cells can be highly unpredictable.

This means there are often very **individual dietary triggers**. Minor ingredients or specific foods may have a negligible histamine content (a "0" rating on the SIGHI list), yet still cause mast cell degranulation and trigger a full spectrum of symptoms. For this reason, a low-histamine diet is a starting point upon which you must build your own personalized plan based on careful observation of your body.

## The SIGHI List: The Gold Standard

The most reliable and rigorous source of information regarding histamine content in food is the **SIGHI** (Swiss Interest Group Histamine Intolerance) list.

The list classifies products on a clear scale from 0 to 3:

- **0 (Well tolerated):** At standard intake, these should not trigger symptoms (subject to individual reactions).
- **1 (Moderately tolerated):** May trigger mild symptoms with frequent consumption or in larger quantities.
- **2 (Poorly tolerated):** Cause distinct symptoms; avoidance is recommended.
- **3 (Very poorly tolerated):** Strong triggers; strictly contraindicated.

Importantly, the SIGHI list accounts not only for histamine itself but also for **histamine liberators** (foods that stimulate the body to release its own histamine, e.g., citrus fruits) and **DAO enzyme blockers** (e.g., alcohol or black tea).

## What You Can Eat (Generally safe foods - "0" on the SIGHI list)

- Fresh meat (poultry, beef, pork)
- Freshly caught or deep-frozen fish
- Most fresh vegetables (e.g., carrots, zucchini, broccoli, cucumber, potatoes, celery)
- Selected fruits (e.g., apples, blueberries, peaches, melons)
- Certain grains and tolerated starches (rice, quinoa, millet, oats, potato starch)
- Young, non-fermented cheeses (e.g., cottage cheese, mozzarella) and dairy alternatives (e.g., oat, rice, or coconut milk)

## What to Strictly Avoid (High histamine and liberators)

- Fermented foods (sauerkraut, pickles, soy sauce, wine vinegar)
- Aged cheeses (parmesan, gouda, cheddar, camembert)
- Processed, smoked, and dried meats (cold cuts, salami, sausages, bacon)
- Vegetables and fruits high in histamine or liberators (tomatoes, spinach, eggplant, avocado, strawberries, raspberries, citrus fruits)
- Canned seafood and fish
- Alcohol and cocoa

> **Important Note:** The individual triggers mentioned earlier can also be excipients hidden in medications, supplements, or processed foods. Examples include corn starch, dyes (e.g., titanium dioxide, iron oxide), as well as carriers and glazing agents (crospovidone, propylene glycol). Carefully reading ingredient lists is an absolute necessity.

## Sample One-Day Menu (Strictly SIGHI "0" Foods)

**Breakfast: Oatmeal with Apple and Blueberries**

- Rolled oats (not instant) cooked in water or oat milk.
- A handful of fresh blueberries and half a peeled, diced apple.
- A tablespoon of pumpkin seeds.

**Snack: Crunchy Mozzarella Snack**

- Natural plain rice cakes (100% rice).
- Slices of fresh mozzarella.
- Fresh, peeled cucumber; a pinch of non-iodized salt.

**Lunch: Braised Chicken with Potatoes and Broccoli**

- Fresh chicken breast (frozen immediately after purchase, thawed in cold water just before cooking), braised in a pan with a splash of high-quality olive oil, salt, and fresh oregano.
- Boiled young potatoes and steamed broccoli florets.

**Dinner: Summer Zucchini and Carrot Cream Soup**

- Fresh zucchini and carrots quickly boiled, blended into a smooth cream with a dash of olive oil and salt.
- Served with previously cooked (and properly cooled) quinoa.

## Tips for keeping an effective food diary

- **Full Ingredient Rule:** Don't just write "lunch." List every ingredient: spices, type of oil used, and even the brand of the product. In MCAS, it’s often not the food itself but a specific additive (like a dye or filler) that causes the issue.

- **Monitor Reaction Time:** Note the exact time of the meal and the time symptoms appear. Histamine reactions can be immediate or delayed by several hours.

- **Intensity Scale:** Rate your symptoms on a scale of 1–10. This helps you distinguish between a "minor discomfort" and a significant flare-up.

- **Include Non-Food Factors:** Mast cells respond to more than just food. Note stress levels, sleep quality, exposure to scents (perfumes, chemicals), weather changes, or physical exertion. Often, symptoms occur only when multiple triggers overlap (the "bucket effect").

- **The 48-Hour Rule:** If a reaction occurs, look back at least two days in your diary. Histamine can accumulate in the body over time.

## Conclusion: The Path to Balance

Implementing a low-histamine diet is a process that requires patience and mindfulness. While the beginning may seem challenging due to the numerous restrictions, the reward is significantly improved well-being and reduced inflammation.

Remember that every person is unique – the SIGHI list is your compass, but you are the best observer of your own reactions. Keeping a food diary will help you create a safe "green list" of products that will restore your quality of life. This diet is not just about limitations; it is, above all, an investment in your long-term health and the peace of your immune system.
