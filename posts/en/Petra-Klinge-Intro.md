# Dr. Petra Klinge: Redefining the "Invisible" Pathologies of the Spinal Cord

In a medical landscape where a diagnosis often begins and ends with an MRI scan, **Dr. Petra Klinge** stands out as a pioneer who prioritizes the patient’s clinical reality. As a Professor of Neurosurgery at Brown University and a lead surgeon at Rhode Island Hospital, Dr. Klinge has become a vital figure for the Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), hypermobility, and neuro-immunological communities.

Her work bridges the gap between complex cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and spinal biomechanics. She was among the first to provide scientific evidence that a "normal" MRI does not rule out debilitating neurological conditions, specifically **Occult Tethered Cord Syndrome (OTCS)**.

## Signs and Symptoms of Tethered Cord: What You Shouldn't Ignore
*(A Summary of Dr. Klinge’s Insights from the "Bendy Bodies" Presentation)*

In her landmark discussion, Dr. Klinge explains why Tethered Cord Syndrome (TCS) is frequently misdiagnosed and why traditional neurosurgical approaches often fail hypermobile patients.

### 1. The "Normal MRI" Trap
Dr. Klinge emphasizes that the term **"occult" (hidden)** refers to cases where a patient displays clear clinical symptoms of a tethered cord, even if the radiologist sees a "normal" conus position. For Dr. Klinge, the physical examination and the patient's history are far more diagnostic than a static image.



### 2. The "Tight Onesie" Analogy
One of the most profound takeaways from her talk is the description of how tethering affects the entire body, not just the lower back:

* **Global Tension:** Many patients describe a sensation of being in a **"tight onesie"** or a "suit that is two sizes too small," causing tension in the chest, neck, or even the throat.
* **Hand Dexterity:** Tethering can affect fine motor skills. Patients often report "clumsy" hands or difficulty with handwriting and opening jars—symptoms traditionally not associated with the lower spine.
* **Deep, Wandering Pain:** Unlike typical sciatica, TCS pain is often described as "deep in the bones," burning, or "heavy," and it can move between legs or worsen with specific postures.

### 3. Objective Neurological Markers
Since imaging can be deceptive, Dr. Klinge relies on specific physical markers to confirm the diagnosis:

* **Spasticity:** Increased muscle tone in the legs.
* **Clonus:** A series of involuntary, rhythmic muscular contractions and relaxations, often seen at the ankle.
* **Hyperreflexia:** Overactive or overresponsive reflexes (knee/ankle jerks), which indicate that the central nervous system is under stress.

### 4. The Filum Terminale as a "Spinal Tendon"
Dr. Klinge views the *filum terminale* (the structure that anchors the cord) as a dynamic organ rather than just a vestigial string. In her research on EDS patients, she discovered:

* **Collagen Micro-damage:** The filum in hypermobile patients shows "loops" and "kinks" similar to overstressed tendons in athletes.
* **Neuro-inflammation:** The presence of **mast cells (MCAS)** and calcifications within the filum tissue suggests that mechanical stress triggers a chronic inflammatory response.

### 5. Future Research: The Spinal Cord Motion Project
Dr. Klinge’s upcoming research focuses on **spinal cord dynamics**. Her hypothesis suggests that a tethered cord disrupts the coordination of paraspinal muscles from the neck to the sacrum. This explains why releasing the tethered cord can sometimes improve upper cervical stability and resolve symptoms of dysautonomia or "brain fog."

### A Message to the Community

> "Trust your body. If you feel that something is wrong, you are likely right, even if your tests are labeled as normal."

For the **NeuroImmune Hub** community, Dr. Klinge’s work is a testament to the fact that we are finally beginning to understand the complex intersection of biomechanics, the immune system, and connective tissue.
