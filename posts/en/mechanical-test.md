Many patients struggling with chronic exhaustion (ME/CFS) and neurological symptoms bounce around doctors' offices for years with perfectly normal test results. Sometimes, however, the breakthrough doesn't come from a lab, but from careful observation of your own body. Changing your biomechanics – taking the mechanical tension off your nervous system – can quiet down symptoms in a matter of days when no medication could.

Here is how you can use simple, at-home postural modifications to check if your symptoms have a purely mechanical root, such as Occult Tethered Cord Syndrome (Occult TCS) or Craniocervical Instability (CCI).

### Step 1: The Collar Test (Upper-Level Tension)

A tethered cord pulls the entire nervous system downward, which often leads to secondary instability in the neck (CCI) and brainstem compression. To check if this mechanism applies to you, you can perform a simple stabilization test.

- **How to do it:** Wear a semi-rigid cervical collar for a few days (e.g., 3 days straight, including during sleep if possible and safe).
- **How to interpret the result:** A semi-rigid collar doesn't immobilize the neck completely, but it takes on some of the weight of the head (about 5 kg) and prevents micro-movements that irritate the brainstem. If after 2-3 days of wearing the collar you feel drastic relief – e.g., your "brain fog" lifts, you have more energy, and your tachycardia subsides – it is a massive clue that your issues stem from instability and mechanical compression at the top of your spine.

### Step 2: The "Mechanical Slack" Tests (Lower-Level Tension)

If the cord is tethered at the bottom, the thickest nerves in your legs (like the sciatic nerve) act like tow ropes, brutally pulling the nervous system downward with every extension. Cutting off this tension by modifying your leg position is the best amateur test for TCS.

Try consciously using the following positions for a few days and observe the reaction in your energy levels (PEM) and pain:

- **Walking on your toes:** Instead of placing your flat foot on the ground, walk around your home entirely on your toes (or wear shoes with a slight heel wedge). Elevating the heel immediately shortens the path of the sciatic nerve down the back of the leg, giving the spinal cord some slack.
- **Sitting "tucked in":** When sitting on a couch or chair, avoid letting your legs hang freely to the floor. Instead, sit with your legs tucked (knees pulled up toward your chest). This position neutralizes the traction on the pelvic nerves.
- **Fetal position (side-lying):** This is the absolute classic for dropping tension. Lie on your side, pull your knees tightly to your chest, and round your back (tuck your chin). This position maximally slacks the entire neural chain from your neck down to your feet.
- **Sleeping with bent knees:** Lying flat on your back with straight legs is torture for a tethered cord. Lie on your back and place a large bolster or several pillows under your knees so they remain constantly bent.

**Note: What if the tests don't work?**
This is a crucial point. If you do not feel improvement after these postural changes, **it absolutely does not mean that you 100% do not have TCS or CCI**. A lack of response to at-home postural methods can simply mean that:

1. **The tension is too severe:** The cord tethering (e.g., by thick fibrotic tissue or a lipoma) might be so strong that simply bending your knees is not enough to offset the mechanical traction.
2. **The damage is too advanced:** Chronic, multi-year compression of the brainstem or peripheral nerves may have led to entrenched inflammatory and neurological changes that will not reverse in a few days just from a change in position.
3. **Co-occurring pathologies:** An extremely overreactive immune system (MCAS) can sustain an inflammatory storm regardless of a temporary drop in mechanical tension.

_Summary: These at-home experiments are merely a diagnostic clue. A positive result is a nearly certain sign of biomechanical issues. A negative result does not definitively rule anything out. Wearing a collar for extended periods without medical supervision can lead to neck muscle atrophy, so treat this strictly as a short-term verification test before pursuing specialized diagnostics (e.g., a prone MRI)._
