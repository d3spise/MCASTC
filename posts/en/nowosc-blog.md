# New Chapter: Regular Updates on the Blog

Hi Everyone!

I am happy to announce a small reactivation. From now on, new content will appear on the blog at more regular intervals. I plan to expand the content available on the site.

I want this place to be alive and be a source of interesting content for you. I do not impose a strict schedule on myself, but you can expect posts "every now and then" – often enough to stay up to date, but without unnecessary spam.

I encourage you to check back here and follow the upcoming changes. See you soon in the first new post!

Best regards!
